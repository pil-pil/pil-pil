- 👋 Hi, I’m @pil-pil
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics, Agent Based Modelling and Economical models, specially about credit derivatives.
🌱 I’m currently finishing my PhD in Mathematics, with a thesis about heterogeneous beliefs in a competitive bond market with CDS sold as protection on one of the issuers. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that is related to modelling credit derivatices with ABM.
